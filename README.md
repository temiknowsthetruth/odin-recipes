# odin-recipes
I learnt how links and images work as well as the difference between absolute links and relative links. 
This is demonstrated in the project when i make links to other recipes within the directory
I also learnt effective use of lists, unordered and ordered, which i used in the listing of ingredients, recipes and steps to make the various foods
Finally, it is also a demonstration of basic html concepts in action
